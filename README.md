## Monthly Vote

Each month, stream community members may vote on items that I will do:
1. During the week before the 1st Monday of each month, each individual can submit 1 response to a survey. The response will include an instruction of a task for me to do as well as the Twitch username of the respondent (username needed to verify eligibility of submission).
2. On the 1st Monday of the month, I will review and transfer the submissions into a second survey (Note: anything that would violate the law or would ruin me physically, financially, or professionally will automatically be excluded).
3. The 
4. I perform the approved items over the rest of the month, or when appropriate. Items that can be done on stream will be done on stream. For items that cannot be done on stream, I will do my best to document and showcase the evidence of having done them.

Example:
1. Survey opens on Monday May 31, 2021 at night after stream ends. All submissions between then and Monday June 7, 2021 at 5 PM Eastern time will be considered in that month's vote.
2. Between 5 PM and start of stream on Monday June 7, 2021, I review the submissions. Approved submissions are put into a separate survey before start of stream on Monday June 7, 2021. Survey will be live by start of stream and can be reviewed on stream if desired.
