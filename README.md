## About the Monthly Vote

TL;DR:
1. You submit items.
2. You vote on the items.
3. I do the items.

At the beginning of each month, stream community members may vote on items that I will do:
1. Each individual submits a response to a survey containing an instruction of a task for me to do.
2. I review and transfer the submissions into a poll (Note: anything that could violate the law or could ruin me physically, financially, or professionally will automatically be excluded).
3. Each individual may then submit one response to this poll of either 'yes' or 'no' selected on all items, where 'yes' can only be selected for up to 1/3 of the items. Each individual's votes will be weighted based on their stream engagement during the previous month (redeeming channel points, cheering bits, subbing, or gifting subs). Weighted majority 'yes' will approve an item, abstains not factored.
4. I perform the approved items over the rest of the month, or when appropriate. Items that can be done on stream will be done on stream. For items that cannot be done on stream, I will do my best to document and showcase the evidence of having done them.
